Physics Buoyancy Calculator
Project Description:
This program allows the user to test custom cubes in different liquids,
and see the ranked results of how buoyant their cube was in the given liquid,
as well as seeing the ranked results of their tests.

It prompts the user to choose a liquid to test their cube in,
then asks them to choose the mass and volume of their test cube.
At that point, the program runs calculations to see how well
their cube floated (or sank).

They are then prompted to see if they want to test another cube.

Once the user is finished with their cube tests, they may exit the program.

When the program is finished, it displays the tests they ran, and
shows them the ranked results of their tests.
